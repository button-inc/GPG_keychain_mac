### gpg-agent setup
Need to setup gpg-agent first, on OSX I use keychain (it also does ssh-agent)
```
$ brew info keychain
keychain: stable 2.8.5
User-friendly front-end to ssh-agent(1)

### gpg passphrase in keychain
```
brew install gpg gpg2 pinentry-mac
```

```
mkdir -m 0700 ~/.gnupg
echo 'pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac' | tee '~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf'
pkill -TERM gpg-agent
```

Close and reopen shell.

Test:
```
echo test | gpg -e -r <identity> | gpg -d
```
